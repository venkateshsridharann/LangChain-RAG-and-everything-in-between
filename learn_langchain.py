I should use Wikipedia to find the answer.
Action: Wikipedia
Action Input: "Back to the Future"
Observation: Page: Back to the Future
Summary: Back to the Future is a 1985 American ...... prompted numerous books about its production, documentaries, and commercials.

Page: Back to the Future (franchise)
Summary: Back to the Future is an American science fiction comedy ..... as well as a video game and a stage 
Thought: I now know the final answer.
Final Answer: The movie Back to the Future was released on July 3, 1985.

> Finished chain.
The movie Back to the Future was released on July 3, 1985.
